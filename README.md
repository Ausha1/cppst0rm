# cppst0rm
A more automated and mainstream version of Mineek's Sunst0rm (https://github.com/mineek/sunst0rm)

## Note to all users who encounter any issues: DO NOT open any issues in futurerestore. Weather that be on Discord, or GitHub, this program does not use futurerestore incorrectly, and issues with futurerestore are unlikely. Instead, get support in cppst0rm's (Discord server)[https://discord.gg/gUwb4Apw] or (sunst0rm's Discord server)[https://discord.gg/TqVH6NBwS3] since these two repositories hold the same effect.

## Since this program is so automated, I fealt not the need of a guide, but if any help is needed, please refer to cppst0rm's Discord server first. I was the one who made it, and thus will be able to provide more help.

## Things to Undrstand
- This utility uses a checkm8 exploit to downgrade your device *teathered*. This means that every time your iPhone turns off, weather that be shut down, restarting, battery dying, or whatever, you have to use this program to turn it back on.
- On A10 - A11 devices, crucial functionality like the Home Button, Audio, Micraphone, and Vibration DO NOT work at the moment.
- On iPhone X, the touch screen does not work after downgrading, but the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are fine.
- You should NOT do this to your main device. The downgrade is not exactly stable since there will be some issues. For example, on the iPhone SE 1st generation (iPhone8,4), the Compass, Dication/Siri, and flashlight have some issue related to them. In my case, Siri, Dictation, and the Compass did NOT work at all, while the flashlight's only issue was a delay from pressing the button in control center.
